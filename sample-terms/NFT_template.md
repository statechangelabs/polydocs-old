## OWNERSHIP

You acknowledge and agree that {{LongCompanyName}} (“{{ShortCompanyName}}”) (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have in and to the Art are limited to those expressly stated in Section 3 of these Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) below. {{ShortCompanyName}} and its licensors reserve all rights in and to the Art not expressly granted to you in Section 3 of these Terms including, without, limit the right to reproduce, create derivative Art, distribute and display the Art.

## TERMS

Subject to your rightful and lawful purchase or acquisition of the NFT and, with respect to a Purchased NFT, your continued compliance with these Terms, {{ShortCompanyName}} grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license, with no right to sub-license, to display the Art for your Purchased NFTs, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use (for example home display, display in a virtual gallery or as an avatar); (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application. The license to display the Art for the purchased NFT is automatically and always transferred with the NFT as provided below in Section 5. Otherwise the license to display the Art for the purchased NFT is non-transferable.

## RESTRICTIONS

You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the following without {{ShortCompanyName}}’s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify, distort or perform any other change to the Art for your Purchased NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs as a brand or trademark or to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others or promote illegal activities; (iv) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased NFTs; (vii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in connection with defamatory or dishonest statements about {{ShortCompanyName}} and/or its affiliated companies or which otherwise damage the goodwill, value or reputation of {{ShortCompanyName}} or represent or imply that your exercise of the license in Section 3 is endorsed by {{ShortCompanyName}} and/or its affiliated companies; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property), you understand and agree as follows: (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (x) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, {{ShortCompanyName}} may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (y) to the extent that {{ShortCompanyName}} informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of these Terms. The restrictions in Section 4 will survive the expiration or termination of the license granted in Section 3. The NFT, and any product or service related to the NFT, is not available to certain individuals, countries, or territories deemed sanctioned by governing bodies. Please refer to the sanction websites for the United States (<https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information>), countries of the European Union (<https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main>), and Switzerland (<https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/de/home/Aussenwirtschaftspolitik_Wirtschaftliche_Zusammenarbeit/Wirtschaftsbeziehungen/exportkontrollen-und-sanktionen/sanktionen-embargos/sanktionsmassnahmen.html>) for up-to-date lists at the time of this reading. {{ShortCompanyName}} accepts no liability for losses to any party based in any of the foregoing countries or territories arising out of, or in connection with, any order for any of the products or services, including NFTs, detailed on this website/application.

## LIMITATIONS AND NO RIGHT TO TRADEMARKS

Without limitation to Section 4 above, the license in Section 3 does not include: (i) the right to use the Art to create additional NFTs; (ii) the right to create derivative works of the Art; (iii) the right to, and you may not, use any {{ShortCompanyName}} trademarks in connection with the exercise of your license in Section 3. No {{ShortCompanyName}} trademarks are licensed to you. You may not use or attempt to register any asset, including any domain names, social media accounts or related addresses, that contains or incorporates any artwork, other representation, name or mark that may be confusingly similar to {{ShortCompanyName}} trademarks. The limitations in Section 5 will survive the expiration or termination of the license granted in Section 3.

## TRANSFERS 

You have the limited right to transfer the Purchased NFT, provided that (a) any such transfer shall be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to restrictions under trade regulations; (b) the transferee accepts all the Terms and the transferee shall, by purchasing, accepting, accessing or otherwise using the Art, be deemed to accept all the Terms; (c) you provide notice to the transferee of the Terms including a link or other method by which the Terms can be accessed by the transferee; (d) you have not breached the Terms before the transfer; and (e) your license to the Purchased NFT has not been terminated before the transfer.

## TERMINATION AND CONSEQUENCES

The license granted in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that you rightfully and lawfully purchased or acquired the NFT and, with respect to a Purchased NFT, you continue to Own the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted in Section 3 to you will immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those NFTs.  The license granted in Section 3 will also automatically terminate, with all rights returning to {{ShortCompanyName}} if: (a) you breach any of the Terms which shall include, without limit, transferring, selling, donating or otherwise disposing of the Purchased NFT in a way not allowed specifically under the Terms; (b) you engage in any unlawful business practice related to the Purchased NFT or (c) if other circumstances occur which would make it unreasonable for the party to remain bound to the agreement until the next regular effective date of termination. In case you did not rightfully and lawfully purchase or acquire the NFT or upon any termination of the license granted in Section 3, {{ShortCompanyName}} may disable your access to the Art and/or deny access to any further benefits, services or goods associated with the NFT and you shall delete, remove or otherwise destroy any backup or single digital copy of the Art.

## DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
